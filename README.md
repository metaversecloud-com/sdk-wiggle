### How To Play

- Users can play by walking inside of the game asset’s private zone
- Users can ‘spectate’ by clicking on the game asset while outside the private zone
- Nobody is able to join the game or spectate if they are not in the world

### Game Mechanics

- Click “Join Game” to create a wiggle and join the game.
- Use your mouse to move your wiggle.
- Eat food (the red circles) to grow in length.
- If your wiggle is blocked (runs into) another wiggle, your game ends - try again.
- If you block another wiggle, you get a point.
- Blocking bots doesn’t give you a point.
- If you block a bot, your wiggle increases by ¼ of the bot’s length.
- If you block a player, your wiggle increases by ½ of that player’s length.
- Your wiggle will also shrink over time. The bigger it gets, the faster it shrinks.
